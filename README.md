# About me
My name is Atirut and I am a hobbyist programmer. Most of the projects I made are to play around with stuff, but there are some projects I am actively working on, too.

# Skills
- Lua
- C#
- GDScript

# Highlights
- [Bake](https://github.com/atirut-w/bake) - A Makefile interpreter written in Lua I made to automate making softwares in OpenComputers.
- [LDB](https://github.com/atirut-w/ldb) - A Lua debugger(again, written in Lua) that I made to help debug Lua codes.
- [OCLinux](https://github.com/atirut-w/oclinux) - My attempt at making a ~~UNIX-ish~~ Linux-ish OS for OpenComputers.
- [Godot Game Jolt API](https://github.com/atirut-w/godot-game-jolt-api) - The name explains it all.
